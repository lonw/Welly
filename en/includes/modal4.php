          &nbsp;&nbsp;Over 20% of Canadian income earners are self employed, business for self or are 100% commissioned. With this large of a segment of the population working for themselves you would think the mortgage banks in Canada would be a little more accommodating. Well they have! Finally. Most people in business write off expenses before declaring their income. That's the advantage of being in business for yourself. You pay income tax on a lesser amount but when you need to prove income for a mortgage approval, your tax returns make it look like your income is low and you can't afford the mortgage you deserve. Qualifying for a Low Documentation Mortgage is easier than you think. You can purchase a new property or re-finance your existing home up to 90% of its appraised value. The lender bases their mortgage approval on your good credit history instead of your net income. At Welly Mortgage we understand your needs. Our lenders look at your credit history rather than business financials and personal tax notice of assessments. This is something most mortgage lenders won't do. With Welly and our preferred lenders, you will find a product that is right for you.</p>

        <p>Please remember each application is unique and these are just some examples of the current products available to business-for-self persons. Here are a few things to remember when shopping for a mortgage:
A self-employed person with a clean credit history in most cases will receive the lowest rates available.
Although an established credit history does improve your interest rate, it is not a requirement for obtaining a mortgage.
Please keep in mind that the property must be in or near a major center.
