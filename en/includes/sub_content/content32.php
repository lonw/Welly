Provincial Nomination Certificate. The Ontario Provincial Nominee can accept
2,500 applications each year. Employer-sponsored migration is employer-led,
which means that as an individual, you can only apply once your employer's
application is reviewed and approved. Once approved, the Ontario Nominee Office
will provide your employer with a set of candidate application materials to be
forwarded to you. All applications will be handled on a first-come, first-served
basis and assessed according to the criteria of the program. Due to the limited
number of places, employers are encouraged to apply early so as to obtain the
quota they need<br><br>Advantages of employer - sponsored migration program<br>
