	with the appropriate employer and work. Applicants must register for a Job
	Bank, unless they have already received a Job Offer or a Provincial
	nomination. If the applicant does not register Job Bank within 30 days after
	the EE is submitted, the applicant's EE will expire. Register the Job Bank

	- If an EE applicant has an employer or provincial nominee of 600 points,
	the applicant can get an invitation within one month of submitting the
	application. The applicant will have an average cycle of six months, which
	is very fast (there is no consideration of waiting for the employer Employer
	approval and application for provincial nomination time, plus the average
	period of about 1 year or so).<br class="auto-style1" />
	- There are no employers or provincial nominees for EE applicants. They do
	not have the time to apply for an employer or provincial nomination. IELTS
	and ECA (1-2 months on average) can submit EE requests directly. The key to
	getting the invitation is to see their scores in the Express Entry system
	and the number of invitations in each case. On the condition may be 1-2
	months to get the invitation to the general conditions may be 6 months 8
	months or even 10 months, the conditions may be even worse 1 year EE expires
	after the invitation can not be re-submitted only EE Wait for the invitation
