        <p>Canadians may borrow for different reasons â€“ job loss, education, home renovations, large purchases, etc. The valuable equity that you may already have in your home can be used to consolidate high interest credit card debts, credit lines and even car loans. Pulling equity out of your home at today's great interest rates can save you as much as 17% a month in interest charges! In the past, for a client to consolidate credit card and loan debts, a second mortgage was your only choice. Did you know second mortgage rates can be as high as 19%? Since secured home loans are based on the equity in your home, they are considered low risk by lenders. Therefore, you can use the low interest loans or lines of credit to pay off high interest credit cards and debts. By consolidating debt, you can also free up cash flow. Using one low interest loan to pay off several high interest loans will mean you only make one debt payment a month.
