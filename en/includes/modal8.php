        <p>The subject property of borrower is the most important collateral for the principal of the lender. What is more, our team is good at risk management, which controls the risks to the minimum: </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Firstly, we make sure the borrowerâ€™s overall LTV does not exceed 80%. This is especially crucial for the borrowers who have already the first mortgage on the property.</li>
            <li>Secondly, we only lend on properties within GTA, so that you can go and see the properties.</li>
            <li>Thirdly, we make sure that every borrower has a good credit rating degree.</li>
          </ul>
